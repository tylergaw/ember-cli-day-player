# Ember-cli-day-player

THIS HAS ZERO FUNCTIONALITY RIGHT NOW

Ember-cli addon for creating placeholder images. WIP

This is a port of the [Day Player Sketch Plugins](https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player).

I made it mainly as a way to help me learn how to work build ember-cli addons,
but maybe it'll be of use.
